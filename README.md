# Car Detection and License Plate Recognition

This project includes a backend built with Flask for car detection and license plate recognition, and a frontend built with React for uploading car images and displaying results.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
3. Git (to clone the repository)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <[your-repo-url](https://github.com/Akcanbasri/Image-Detaction)>
cd <Image-Detaction>
```

### Step 2: Download the Models

Download the models from the following Dropbox link and place them in the `models` directory within the repository:

[Download Models](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/n7irsd2of4d5u2vs1w83x/AIwF_p9rNNIIcSAyR205m1c?rlkey=xvj2tgg6q7pnrrgw8koq81gy2&st=fo7fmz61&dl=0)

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the Flask backend is running.
2. Ensure the React frontend is running.
3. Open the frontend application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
4. Upload a car image and view the results.
